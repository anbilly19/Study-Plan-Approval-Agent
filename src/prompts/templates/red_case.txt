I’m submitting my study plan as a Physics major with Math as my minor. I’m taking PHY-101, PHY-220, and PHY-300 for my major, plus MTH-110, MTH-215, and MTH-300 for my minor – all the core requirements. I didn’t stop there; I picked up CSC-101 because I’m interested in programming, and BUS-400 since I want to get a perspective on corporate strategy. I know my plan is intense and that some classes overlap, but I really want to push myself and cover as much as possible this semester, even if it gets overwhelming.
