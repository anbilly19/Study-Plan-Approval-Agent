So for my study plan, I’m majoring in Economics and picking International Business as my minor.
I’ve got ECO-101 and ECO-220 for my core, and IB-400 as part of the minor.
But honestly, I want my university experience to be more well-rounded.
That’s why I added MTH-215 (Linear Algebra) and MKT-205 (Principles of Marketing) this semester, even though they’re outside my main track.
I also chose CHM-101 and BUS-101 because I’m curious about chemistry and business fundamentals.
I realize there’s some overlap and my days will get busy, but I think exploring different departments will make my studies richer
