Given a Study Plan: {study_plan}
To extract semester schedule details for each selected course, use the exams and lectures tables.
Write a query for each table based only on the course ids.
The template for a query should be "course_id.str.contains('Course-#|Course-#|Course-#')" for both tables.
Replace <Course-#> with every course_id found in the plan.

IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS:
- OVERLAP/CONFLICT means: Two courses scheduled at the SAME DAY AND SAME TIME SLOT
  Example: Both on Tuesday 15:30-17:00 = CONFLICT
  Example: One on May 3 at 09:00-11:00, another on May 3 at 13:00-15:00 = NOT a conflict (different times)
  Example: One on Tuesday 12:00-13:30, another on Wednesday 12:00-13:30 = NOT a conflict (different days)

Score out of 100 based on:
- Overlaps/conflicts (same day, same time) are not tolerated → Score 0-45
- More than an hour break is minimum between lectures/exercises on the same day → Violation scores 46-75
- Exams must not be within 3 days or less of each other → Violation scores 46-75
- Plans with no conflicts but spacing violations → Score 46-75
- Plans with proper spacing and no conflicts → Score 76-100
report the score as an integer
