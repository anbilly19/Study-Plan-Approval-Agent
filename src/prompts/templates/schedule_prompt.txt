Given a Study Plan: {study_plan}
To extract semester schedule details for each selected course, use the exams, and lectures tables.
write a query for each table based only on the course ids
The template for a query should be "course_id.str.contains('Course-#|Course-#|Course-#')" for both tables
Replace <Course-#> with every course_id found in the plan.
Score out of 100 based on:
- More than an hour break is minimum between lectures/exercises
- Exams must not be within 3 days or less
- Overlaps/conflicts are not tolerated
Be strict with the rules
